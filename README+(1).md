## General Information
BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people.They have planned to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs. For which they have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.



## Conclusions
Model:
Count = 0.4648 * atemp + 0.2357 * yr + 0.0258 * workingday + 0.0092 * weekday + 0.0474 * winter -0.1252 * spring - 0.0752 * (Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist)  -0.2915 * (Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds)
